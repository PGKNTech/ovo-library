# OvO's Diary Prototype


# Great Feature: 
OvO's library includes a login page and a cool security feature, the bypass option.

# About OvO's Library
This prototype was designed to make a safe environment for any user's private information. PGKNT created OvO's diary as a mini project to learn Batch scripting. You can store passwords, and secrets like a functional diary. 

# Prototype
For Now, OvO's library is stored in a batch file and soon to be developed into a functional software. And you can only enter text like secrets and stories into the batch file. So you can still keep your secrets on the OvO's library and may be mmake it a personal digital diary for now. OvO's Diary prototype can only run on windows yet since it uses the command prompt to function.

OvO's library is not yet fully functional and the user can only customize it on file edit since the batch file is editable using a text editor. That is why this isnt functional as a secured application. Information you put are stored locally on your computer.

# About  Bypass
Bypass is a feature embeded on the program. When a user forgets his/her password, they can type F to access the forgot password page then type byp to bypass security systems provided on the program. But, it is not intended for that. It is intended for intruders who has access to your copy of the library and wants to bypass the program's security measures. After some time of going through the bypass, the intruder will recieve a prompt on cmd that their IP Address is being collected (which is false). After few clicks, they will be redirected to a website playing Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give you Up.
