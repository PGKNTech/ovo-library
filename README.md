# About OvO's Library
This prototype was designed to make a safe environment for any user's private information. PGKNT believes that such information is not safe in File Explorer alone since Windows Home version does not include its default bitlock. Another purpose of the library is to keep users from storing their passwords on a txt file which some people still do for convenience. With OvO's library, it is much convenient to store text or private information as it can keep it secure locally.

# Prototype
For Now, OvO's library is stored in a batch file and soon to be developed into a functional software. And you can only enter  text and not files into the program prototype. But let alone text can be secured with the security features it provides. So you can still keep your darkest secrets on the OvO's library and may be mmake it a personal digital diary for now. OvO's library prototype can only run on windows yet since it uses the command prompt to function.

OvO's library is not yet fully functional and the user can only customize it on file edit since the batch file is editable using a text editor. 

# About  Bypass
Bypass is a feature embeded on the program. When a user forgets his/her password, they can type F to access the forgot password page then type byp to bypass security systems provided on the program. But, it is not intended for that. It is intended for intruders who has access to your copy of the library and wants to bypass the program's security measures. After some time of going through the bypass, the intruder will recieve a prompt on cmd that their IP Address is being collected (which is false). After few clicks, they will be redirected to a website playing Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give you Up.
